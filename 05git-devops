# Checkout a specific version of a file
git checkout <commit_hash>:<filename>

# Restoring changes from staged file to unstaged
git restore --staged filename.extension
git restore --staged .

# Undoing changes that have been committed but not yet pushed to the remote repo
git revert <commit_id> # Reverts a specific commit:

# If you only want to remove some files, use git reset instead.
# Resetting local changes (unstage and discard changes)
git reset HEAD # Resets your local working tree and index to match the current head commit. Any changes you had in your workspace since then
git reset HEAD -- filename  #To remove just one file.
git reset HEAD               #To remove everything.

# Resetting just one file to match the content of the latest commit of that file
git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file
# Undo local changes that haven’t been committed yet
git reset --hard
# Resetting your working directory to match the last committed state
git reset --hard HEAD
# Resetting your entire project to match the latest commit on the main branch
git reset --hard origin/main

### Advanced Guide
# Changing authorship of a specific commit
git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@example.com>"
# Amending the date of a previous commit
git commit --amend --date="2014-09-30 18:30:07"

# Changing history by altering past commits
git rebase -i <base_commit_id>     #Interactive rebasing

# Forgetting about past commits (this is dangerous and should be used with caution)
git log --grep=<string> | grep -v "Merge" | while read commit; do git branch --contains $commit | while
read line; do if [ "$line" != "" ]; then echo $commit; fi; done | xargs -n1 git rebase --

# Show the commit that introduced a bug
git bisect good v0.23            #The current code is good
git bisect bad v0.24             #The current code is broken
# Now Git will check out the middle commit between v0.23 and v0.24
# Once it does, tell Git whether the current version is good or bad
git bisect run make test          #Run tests to find the problematic commit
# When the tests pass, Git stops and prints the SHA1 of the current commit
